Linked list implementation in  C++ with the following functions:
1.add_user() that takes in the head of the linked list as an argument. The function should take in user details as input, encapsulate it in a node and append it to the end of the Linked List.
2.sort_users() to sort the linked list by name. The argument to the function is the head node.
3. del_user() that deletes a particular user details. Please note that the argument to this function is a pointer to a node to be deleted and not a pointer to the head.
4. median_age() to find the median age among the users. The argument to the function is the head node.
5. average_age() to find the average age among the users. The argument to the function is the head node.
6. max_occupation() to find the occupation that most users have. The argument to the function is the head node.
7. max_location() to find the location that most users have. The argument to the function is the head node.
8. suggest_friends() that suggests friends to a particular user. The argument to the function is the head node and the name of the user to whom you should suggest friends. A person can be suggested as a friend if the two people have the same occupation or location and are in the same age group (maximum age difference of 15 years).
9. segregate_age() that segregates users with odd and even age. The argument to the function is the head node. The users with odd age should appear first, followed by the users with even age and the relative ordering should be maintained.
10. reverse() that reverses the linked list by swapping links and not the data. The argument to the function is the head node of the Linked List.
